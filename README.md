 ![64x64 texture and Sprites Added](images/sprites.PNG)

   I made this small raycasting engine as a way to learn SDL and also some graphical computing, currently it serves as a pseudo Wolfenstein3D clone

   **THIS ENGINE IS IN DEVELOPMENT**, 
   I am currently working on optimizing and adding features to the engine

## Features
   - [ ] Fully textured 64x64 walls
   - [ ] Textured Sprites, static, dynamic and directional
   - [ ] Full colisions for sprites and walls
   - [ ] Smooth keyboard and mouse camera movement

## Todo
   - [ ] Floor and ceiling textures (Performance heavy)
   - [ ] Proper doors
   - [ ] Gameplay(??)
