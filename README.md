# A Raycaster in SDL

## Raycaster with textures

 ![Sample Image](images/raycaster.PNG)

I made this small raycasting engine as a way to learn SDL and also some graphical computing

**THIS ENGINE IS IN DEVELOPMENT**,
I am currently working on optimizing and revamping the engine to be more efficient

## Reference
Alot of the code was direct reference from 3DSage's youtube series on raycasters

Alot of the math was derived from this video
