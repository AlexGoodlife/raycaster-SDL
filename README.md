   I made this small raycasting engine as a way to learn SDL and also some graphical computing

   **THIS ENGINE IS IN DEVELOPMENT**, 
   I am currently working on optimizing and revamping the engine to be more efficient



## Todo
   - [ ] Floor and ceiling textures
   - [ ] Sprites
   - [ ] Improve mouse movement
