# A Raycaster in C

## Raycaster with textures

 ![Sample Image](images/raycaster.png)

I made this small raycasting engine as a way to learn SDL and also some graphical computing

**THIS ENGINE IS NOT VERY EFFICIENT**
It crashes, the collisions (especially for walking backwards) are unpolished and the engine can be **slow** due to it rendering textures as individual points
Of course all of this is subject to improvements

## Reference
Alot of the code was direct reference from 3DSage's youtube series on raycasters

Alot of the math was derived from this video
